The main goals of this package are:

* Graphical analysis of clinical data when subjects are viewed as individuals and groups. *

*This software will deal with .csv files as input and will output graphs that display rank abundance and heat maps.*

*This tool will generate two forms of output, a stacked bar chart that is interactive and heat maps. *
  - this will integrate clinical data and metadata.
